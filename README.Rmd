# intradayModel
Our package uses state-of-the-art state-space models to facilitate the modeling and forecasting of financial intraday signals. This package currently offers a univariate model for intraday trading volume, with new features on intraday volatility and multivariate models in development. It is a valuable tool for anyone interested in exploring intraday, algorithmic, and high-frequency trading.

## Installation
The package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/convexfi/intradayModel):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("convexfi/intradayModel")
```

## Quick Start
To get started, we load our package and some sample data: the 15-minute intraday trading volume of AAPL from 2019-01-02 to 2019-06-28, covering 124 trading days.

```{r, message = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
data(AAPL_volume)
AAPL_volume[1:5, 1:5] # print the head of data
```

Next, we fit a univariate state-space model using `uniModelFit` function. To be specific, we use the first 104 trading days for fitting, and the last 20 days for evaluation of forecasting performance.

```{r}
AAPL_fit <- AAPL_volume[, 1:104]
model_fitted <- uniModelFit(AAPL_fit)
```

Once the model is fitted, we can estimate the hidden components of any intraday signal based on all its observations, which is called **smoothing**. By calling `uniModelSmooth` function, we obtain daily, seasonal, and intraday dynamic components. This procedure helps us better identify the underlying information of the intraday signal.

```{r}
smooth_result <- uniModelSmooth(AAPL_fit, model_fitted)
plot_components(smooth_result) # plot smoothed hidden components
plot_performance(smooth_result) # plot smoothed result
```

To see how well our model performs on new data, we use `uniModelForecast` function to do one-bin-ahead forecast on the out-of-sample dataset of 20 days.

```{r}
forecast_result <- uniModelForecast(AAPL_volume, model_fitted, out.sample = 20)
plot_components(forecast_result) # plot forecast hidden components
plot_performance(forecast_result) # plot forecast result
```
