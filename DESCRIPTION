Title: Univariate State-Space Modeling for Financial Intraday Signal
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2023-4-11
Description: Univariate state-space models fit to financial intraday signal, with a focus on intraday trading volume.  
            Fitting is primarily via the Maximum-likelihood estimation and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. 
            In addition, functions for prediction and filtering are provided.
